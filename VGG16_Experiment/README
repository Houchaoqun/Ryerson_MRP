Scripts and Results of Using VGG16

The code has been adopted from : https://blog.keras.io/building-powerful-image-classification-models-using-very-little-data.html .

Most specifically, it is from the script "bottlenect_pretrained_script_02.py"

There are five data folders: data_00, data_01, data_02, data_03, and data_04. "YAL" stands for Yes-Alzheimers" and "NAL" stands for "No-Alzheimers". The number of files in "alzheimers" and "nonalzheimers" must match. To get download the data, please go to
The following structure is necessary:
    data_##:
         train
            alzheimers
               YAL0001.jpg
               YAL0002.jpg
               etc...
            nonalzheimers
               NAL0001.jpg
               NAL0002.jpg
               etc...
         validation
            alzheimers
               YAL0001.jpg
               YAL0002.jpg
               etc...
            nonalzheimers
               NAL0001.jpg
               NAL0002.jpg
               etc...

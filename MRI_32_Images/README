These are 32 MRI images per patient and there are 133 patients used per category.

Therefore, 3200 images are used per category. For a total of 6400 images.

I will be doing 10-fold. This means 2880 to 320 images.

CDR (Clinical Dementia Rating):
-	0 = nondemented
-	0.5 = very mild dementia
-	1 = mild dementia
-	2 = moderate dementia
-	CDR > 0 : probable AD

I have classified:

0 --> non-alzheimers
>0 --> alzheimers
